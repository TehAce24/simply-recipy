## Description: 🍖
This is a simple recipe book using [Spoonaculars](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) database and coded entirely 
in Python.

## Usage: 🍔
#### Step 1:
> First you need to obtain an API key from
> [Spoonacular.com](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/console#Dashboard) and create an account
> 
> After obtaining the key store it in .env as `api_key = "put_key_here"` in the main directory
#### Step 2:
>Start the Program. Choose up to 5 ingredients and click submit.
#### Step 3:
>Enter the items to include in the recipe. The program will try and find a recipe with the listed ingredients.

Important ones are `customtkinter` for GUI and `PIL` for loading images.

`dotenv` for api key and `ratelimit` for throttling calls.
